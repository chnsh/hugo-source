      <description>This essay will contain a list of lessons that I have (or wish to) learned in my brief stint as a software engineer. I aim to regularly update this list throughout my career and wish to make it a habit to regularly reflect on how I am doing as an individual contributer and in leading a team.
Make time to learn There will always be the need to immediately deliver, do not kid yourself into thinking that that the feature request or the bug fix will salvage you of your ignorance.</description>
