<p>This essay will contain a list of lessons that I have (or wish to) learned in my brief stint as a software engineer. I aim to regularly update this list throughout my career and wish to make it a habit to regularly reflect on how I am doing as an individual contributer and in leading a team.</p>

<h2 id="make-time-to-learn">Make time to learn</h2>

<p>There will always be the need to immediately deliver, do not kid yourself into thinking that that the feature request or the bug fix will salvage you of your ignorance. The only thing that will end up happening is a rise in technical debt that will bite you sooner than later.</p>

<h2 id="manage-time-better">Manage time better</h2>

<p><strong>WRONG</strong> - It&rsquo;s cool to hold everything in your head and not rely on any tool.</p>

<p><strong>RIGHT</strong> - It is cooler to be productive, achieve more and not be stressed all the time about what needs to be done!</p>

<h2 id="be-determined-to-write-quality-code">Be determined to write quality code</h2>

<p>It is not okay to sacrifice in quality just because you are lazy to write tests. A code that cannot be tested easily and a change that leads to a million other changes will only end up making your life bad. When you could be doing better and more advanced things, you will end up wasting time in maintaining a poorly designed codebase.</p>

<h2 id="use-proper-tooling">Use proper tooling</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be okay with spending 5 minutes to manually deploy code everyday. It takes 10 minutes to configure a push event webhook with any decent CI system, use that. Even better, automate the entire CI/CD pipeline (<strong><em>Again</em></strong>, write tests that assist you in integrating with better tooling)</p>

<h2 id="do-things-just-for-the-sake-of-doing-them">Do things just for the sake of doing them</h2>

<p>There will be times when you want to do something that does not have support from the management or something that may not get recognized, or may not contribute to key metrics. If it&rsquo;s in your head, it&rsquo;s worth doing.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-take-anything-at-face-value">Don&rsquo;t take anything at face value</h2>

<p>This one is simple, ask better questions, or even better, ask the right questions!</p>
